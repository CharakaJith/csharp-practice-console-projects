# C# Practice Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level **C# console applications**, each targeting core programming concepts and .NET fundamentals. All projects are grouped under a single Visual Studio solution for organized learning.

## Projects Overview

| 8   | Tic Tac Toe Game          | 2D arrays, loops, win-check logic, clean game structure                |
| 9   | Expense Tracker           | Structs/classes, lists, input validation, file I/O, monthly summary    |
| 10  | Unit Converter            | Switch statements, math logic, loops, metric/imperial conversions      |
| 11  | Password Generator        | Random strings, string manipulation, validation, reusable methods      |
| 12  | File Encryption Tool      | File I/O, Caesar cipher, password protection, string encoding          |

## Requirements

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (.NET Core or .NET 6+)
- Visual Studio / VS Code (recommended)

## Running the Projects

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/csharp-practice-projects.git
   cd csharp-practice-projects
   ```

2. Open the solution file (`csharp-practice-projects.sln`) in Visual Studio.

3. Set the desired project as the startup project.

4. Build and run!

## Folder Structure

```bash
csharp-practice-projects/
│
├── NumberGuessingGame/
├── SimpleCalculator/
├── ToDoListManager/
├── BankAccountSimulation/
├── StudentGradebookSystem/
├── LibraryManagementSystem/
├── ContactBook/
├── TicTacToeGame/
├── ExpenseTracker/
├── UnitConverter/
├── PasswordGenerator/
├── FileEncryptionTool/
├── csharp-practice-projects.sln
└── README.md
```

Each folder contains a self-contained console application with its own `Program.cs`, classes, and assets.

## Learning Goals

These projects aim to reinforce:

- Core programming constructs (loops, conditionals, methods, variables)
- Object-oriented design (classes, encapsulation, abstraction)
- Data structures (lists, arrays, enums)
- File I/O handling and persistence
- User interaction through command-line interfaces
- Reusable code through helper classes/methods
